            <h2>Project#1</h2>
            <h3>Wizzarding Walls</h3>
            <h4>Introduction:</h4>
            <p>
                Wizzarding Walls is a tower defense game developed using the Processing programming language. Players take on the role of commanders who must guide wizards to repel invaders and defend their home.    
            </p>
            <h4>Mechanics Design:</h4>
            <p>
                Players need to consume energy to summon wizards and defeat the invading enemies along the way. When a certain number of invaders reach the gate, the home is lost. Players need to defeat all enemies before their home falls. Each defeated enemy will increase the player's energy, an important resource for summoning wizards.
            </p>

            <h2>Project#1</h2>

            <h4>Character Design:</h4>
            <p>
                Wizards have attributes such as health points, summoning energy, attack power, attack range, attack speed, and skills. A mathematical formula is used to balance the abilities and summoning energy of the characters, enhancing the balance and diversity of the game.
            </p>
            <h4>Level Design:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    In the first level, the type of enemy is singular, and there's only one attack route, allowing players to experience and explore game mechanics and gameplay at a basic difficulty.
                </li>
                <li>
                    In the second level, the variety of enemies is increased, and an additional attack route is added, increasing the strategy based on the first level.
                </li>
                <li>
                    In the third level, enemies attack from two initial points, dividing their forces. The player must also protect two gates. After all regular enemies are defeated, a powerful Boss appears, requiring a good understanding of the game for the player to clear the level successfully.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Rewarding Design:</h4>
            <p>
                After passing each level, players unlock a new character as a reward. This new character can provide players with a new gaming experience and enrich the game's lineup and strategic depth.
